Tool to contemplate and cry

1. Personal Reflection
Sit in a chair alone, contemplating the intricate tapestry of emotions that weave through life.

2. Inner Circle Dynamics
People I thought were friends sit together but away from me, casting shadows on the periphery of my solitude.

2.1. Social Isolation
Alone, I sit, yearning for the warmth of companionship, aching for the closeness of those I once considered friends.

2.2. Emotional Desolation
Alone, I get the urge to cry, a silent plea for connection echoing in the emptiness that surrounds me.
